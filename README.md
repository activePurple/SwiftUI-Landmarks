This is a simple project in progress building the Landmarks App using SwiftUI.

In this app I will have written the app Views, Buttons and the effects that happen as well. 

The goal is to refine and enhance my swift and swift UI skills for future development project. 

The link to the Tutorial can be found here https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/ so you can do it yourself too!
